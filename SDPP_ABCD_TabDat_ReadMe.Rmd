**Update Logs:**

 - 2023.6.6
  
   - To improve compatability of CSV files across different environment (R, Python, MATLAB, LibreOffice, Excel), vaiable names (i.e., Column Names) have been modified. All '.' were replaced by '_'.

 - 2023.6.5
   
   - Add additional parameter in write.csv with fileEncoding='UTF-8'. Now all CSV-files generated by SDPP-ABCD-TabDat will be formated in UTF-8 encoding type.
   
 - 2023.6.3

   - To keep consistent with NDA platform, the variable _'subjectkey'_ will be used as Subject ID to merge data. Because _'subjectkey'_ is the _'NDAR Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for research subject'_. Anyone using ABCD data could easily apply GUID filter to create their own NDA Study, which is the requirements of ABCD DUC terms and condition.
   - Added more comments into R script. Added code blocks to make everything easy to read.
