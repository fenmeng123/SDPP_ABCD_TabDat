**Update Logs:**

 - 2023.07.03
 
   - Errors in measures of height and weight that noted in _'ABCD 5.0 Changes and Known Issues'_ (Page 9) were processed in Step 1 R script. please see attached file _'ABCD5.0_BMI_NotesTable.xlsx'_, where Sheet 'NotesTable' was directly copied from _'ABCD 5.0 Changes and Known Issues.doc'_ (Page 9 & 10), sheet 'ManualCorrectiveTable' was manually generated by Kunru Song (2023.07.03) to correct the value with each subject in it. The second sheet could be used to replace ('correct') the measured values in /physical-health/ph_y_anthro.csv (that is what Step 1 would do). Please download and place it within the folder where SDPP-ABCD-TabDat scripts were storage.
   - At 4-year follow-up, the EHIS was measured again. To keep consistent, youth's handedness indicated by EHIS was determined by the baseline measure, which would be seen as a time-invariant variable.(Section 8 in Step 1)
   - Add function to automatedly save logs.
   - Merge Intersex-Male and Male into Male. Because the number of intersex-male subjects is too small.
   
 - 2023.07.01

   - Add some codes to re-code rel_group_id into a new numeric variable, which could describe the order of youths from same family. A new variable named GroupID will be created within execution of Step1, range from 0 to 3. For single-child family, the value would be set to 0. For multi-child family (sibling, twin or triplet), the corresponding value indicates the order of youths in their family.
   - Old Variables with prefix _'GeneInfo'_ now were replaced by _'GI'_.
   - The top five Principal component of genetic ancestry would be preserved in the preprocess data frame. I did this as a conventional choice such as aCompcor and tCompcor, where we usually extract the top five principal components. It should be noted that such conventional choice did not have particular reason. Usually, the top five PCs are enough to capture the variations in raw data. Because I did not find proper justification for ABCD gentic ancestry PCs, such choice may be an optional and practical process for the genetic ancestry data. Any comments are welcome to address this issue.

   - Revising all codes for ABCD V5.0 Tabulated Data (NDA Collection ID: 2147)
    - In ABCD 5.0 tabulated data, _'src_subject_id'_ would be used as participant identifier.

   - To improve compatability of CSV files across different environment (R, Python, MATLAB, LibreOffice, Excel), vaiable names (i.e., Column Names) have been modified. All '.' were replaced by '_'.

 - 2023.06.05
   
   - Add additional parameter in write.csv with fileEncoding='UTF-8'. Now all CSV-files generated by SDPP-ABCD-TabDat will be formated in UTF-8 encoding type.
   
 - 2023.06.03

   - To keep consistent with NDA platform, the variable _'subjectkey'_ will be used as Subject ID to merge data. Because _'subjectkey'_ is the _'NDAR Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for research subject'_. Anyone using ABCD data could easily apply GUID filter to create their own NDA Study, which is the requirements of ABCD DUC terms and condition.
   - Added more comments into R script. Added code blocks to make everything easy to read.
